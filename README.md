# CodingRoom
Projects from 100days of Python with Angela Yu on Udemy
# This repo basically just tracks my progress through the 100 days of Python on Udemy with Angela. I'm writing this to make myself a committment to be better about giving coding a honest effort. 

# If my dad learned how to code using FOTRAN and punch cards, surely I can learn how to code as well!
